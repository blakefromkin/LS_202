      <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com/course_catalog">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?</p>

    <p class="non-intro">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.</p>

    <!-- Note the &...; formatting above!-->

    <p class="non-intro" id="last-p">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the 'class' attribute as well as an 'id' attribute. We'll use some CSS and the 'id' attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
